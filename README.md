# Movie-Maniac-Android

This project is to showcase the various implementation concepts from Android Development Stack. The following are the implementation concepts / components that I have used in this Movie-Maniac project so far.

- DataBinding with MVvM for binding data to the view
- MVP Framework for separating Android Framework from business logic
- GreenRobot as event bus for communication inside the App
- Retrofit 2.0 for network & rest layer
- ButterKnife for binding views from xml into java implementation
- RecyclerView, CardView
- Palette for generating dynamic colors
- Facebook Sdk for facebook login & share
